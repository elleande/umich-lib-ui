## Does my site need breadcrumbs?

**Do** use breadcrumbs if

- the user is most likely to have landed on the page from an external source
- the website is large and has clear heirarchy

**Don't** use breadcrumbs if

- the site is single-level and doesn't have a logical hierarchy

## Guidelines

- Breadcrumbs should appear in the top left corner of the screen, just below the primary navigation and above the page title.
- The breadcrumb trail should display the current page within the site’s hierarchy, not the session history.
- The breadcrumb trail should start with a link to the homepage.
- Include the current page as the last item in the breadcrumb trail, but do not make it a link.
- Use the “navigate_previous” icon to separate links.
- Breadcrumbs should not wrap to multiple lines. On mobile, consider shortening the breadcrumb trail to only include the last level(s).
- Breadcrumbs are a supporting navigational element and should never replace the primary navigation.
