import { Button } from '@umich-lib/core'

## Primary

Primary buttons are used to highlight the strongest call to action on a page and should only be used once per screen. Not every screen requires a primary button.

```jsx live=true
<Button>Primary button</Button>
```

## Secondary

This is the standard button for most use cases. Default buttons may be used several times per screen.

```jsx live=true
<Button kind="secondary">Secondary button</Button>
```
