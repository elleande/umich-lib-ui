<Text lede>Buttons explain what action will occur when the user clicks or touches it. Buttons are used to trigger actions. They contain a clear label and, sometimes, an icon.</Text>

## When to use which button
- **Primary button**: Use the primary button to call attention to the strongest action on the screen. Primary buttons should only appear once per screen, but not every screen requires a primary button.
- **Default button**: Use the default button for most use cases.

## Guidelines

- Use buttons when the user is performing an action such as “Save” or “Submit”. If a user is navigating to another place, use a link.
- Button labels should clearly indicate the action of the button. Use active verbs.
- Labels should be written in sentence case.
- Aim for labels of 3 words or less and never more than 5.
- Avoid vague labels. For sets of buttons, use specific labels such as “Submit” or “Discard” instead of “OK” or “Cancel”.
