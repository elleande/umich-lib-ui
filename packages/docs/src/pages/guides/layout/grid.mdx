Grid systems are used for creating page layouts through a series of rows and columns that hold content. U-M Library’s Design System uses a responsive, fluid grid system that scales up to 12 columns as the device or viewport size increases.

## Basic structure

## Gutters

The space between columns is called gutters. Gutters vary depending on screen width.

- **Screen width ≥ 768px = 24px gutter** (size L spacing)
- **Screen width < 768px = 12px gutter** (size SM spacing)

## Columns

Designs should be limited to a maximum of 12 columns. Mobile will have 4 columns.

## Margins

The 12 column grid does not have a maximum width. It has a width of 100%, with built-in margins, fixed gutters, and responsive column widths. Margins vary depending on screen width.

- **Screen width ≥ 768px = 5%**
- **Screen width < 768px = 3%**

|Size|px|Gutters|Outer margins|
|----|----|----|----|
|XS|576|12px|3%|
|SM|768|24px|5%|
|M|992|24px|5%|
|L|1200|24px|5%|
|XL|1600|24px|5%|

## Example

Let’s walk through an example where the screen width is 1280px.

- Our margins are 5% of the screen width on each side. This 		results in 64px on the left and 64px on the right.
- Our gutters (11 in total) are fixed, and at this screen width, are 		24px each.
- Our columns (12 in total) are responsive and will automatically 		size to 74px each (remaining 888px divided by 12).
