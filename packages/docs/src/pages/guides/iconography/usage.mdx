Icons are used to provide visual context and enhance usability. U-M Libraryâ€™s Design System uses SVG icons from the [Material UI icon set](https://material.io/tools/icons/) with a 24px viewbox.

```jsx live
<Icon icon="star" />
```

See the [Icon component](/components/icon/code) for full usage documentation.
