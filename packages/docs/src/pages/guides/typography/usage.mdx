## Typefaces

We use “Muli” (a sans-serif Google font) for most of our type, the exception being very large titles for which we use “Crimson Text” (a serif Google font).

## Font weight

Font weight is an important typographic style that can add emphasis and is used to differentiate content hierarchy. Font weight and size pairings must be carefully balanced. The acceptable weights are:

**Muli**: regular (400), semibold (600), and bold (800)

**Crimson Text**: regular (400)

## Line height

Line height is one of several factors that contributes to readability. Line heights are based on the size of the font itself. Ideal line-heights for standard copy have a ratio of 1:1.5. For example, a type of 16px would have a line-height of 24px (16 x 1.5). The exception to this rule are headings (those 24px or more), which need less spacing and therefore have a 1:1.25 ratio.

## Line length

Line length is the number of characters on a single line, including spaces. It directly contributes to the readability of copy.

Lines that are too long degrade eye tracking from line to line, making it difficult to gauge which line to read next. On the other hand, lines that are too short make it difficult for a reader to maintain steady reading rhythm. While there is no perfect width for text, **a good goal is to aim for 50-100 characters per line**.
