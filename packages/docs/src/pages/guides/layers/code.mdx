import { Z_DEPTH } from '@umich-lib/core'

Shadows are used to create layers in the interface. The distance from one layer to another is measured along the z-axis. Both the size and softness of a shadow express the distance between two surfaces. For example, a surface with a shadow that is small and sharp, such as the card below with a **z-depth** of 1, indicates a surfaceâ€™s close proximity to the surface behind it. Larger, softer shadows, such as the card below with a **z-depth** of 2, express more distance.  

```js
import { Z_DEPTH } from '@umich-lib/core'
```

## z-depth 1

```js live
<section
  style={{
    ...Z_DEPTH[1],
    width: '12rem',
    height: '12rem'
  }}
>
</section>
```

- **offset x:** 0px
- **offset y:** 2px
- **Blue radius:** 8px
- **Color:** rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.2)

## z-depth 2

```js live
<section
  style={{
    ...Z_DEPTH[2],
    width: '12rem',
    height: '12rem'
  }}
>
</section>
```

- **offset y:** 4px
- **Blue radius:** 16px
