## Using shadows to create layers

Elements with shadows can help users understand an interface. Shadows indicate hierarchy of elements by differentiating between two objects. In some cases, shadows help users to understand that one object is above another.

## Guidelines
- Use q **z-depth 1** as a hover effect for cards.
- Use q **z-depth 2** for megamenus or other dropdown menus.
- Allow surfaces to move in front of and behind other surfaces, such as scrolling the page behind a dropdown menu.
- Don't use shadows for style only.
- Use shadows to make difference in surface elevation perceptible.
