## Primary

Our primary palette is comprised of maize, blue, and neutrals. These colors are present across most interfaces. Recommendations for when and how to use these shades can be found in [usage](/guides/color/usage).

<ColorPalette colors={['maize', 'blue', 'neutral']} />

## Secondary

Our secondary palette is made up of coral, teal, and beige. These colors are used sparingly to add visual interest and pops of color. Coral doubles as a warning color and teal doubles as a link color. For more information, visit [usage](/guides/color/usage).
