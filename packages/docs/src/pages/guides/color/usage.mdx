Color brings a design to life. Color is versatile; it’s used to express emotion and tone, as well as place emphasis and create associations. Color should always be used in meaningful and intentional ways in order to create patterns and visual cues.

## 0-500 Scale

Each color’s palette consists of about 5 shades numbered from 0-500 in increments of 100, where 0 is the lightest and 500 is the darkest shade. **400 represents our core color** - the shade that is used most frequently in the interface. 500 is slightly darker, and works well for hover states. 0-300 work well for larger blocks of color or backgrounds.

## Typography

All type color combinations must pass WCAG AA standards of 4.5:1 for normal text and 3:1 for large text. **neutral-400** is used for titles, body text, and links. **neutral-300** is used to create hierarchy, and works well for captions or details.

## Intent

Coral, maize, and teal can be used intentionally to draw attention to error states (coral-400), warnings (maize-400), or informational / generally positive states (teal-400).

[**TODO:** Add tables for color intent here.]

## Accessible color combinations

As mentioned above, all color combinations must pass WCAG AA standards of 4.5:1 for normal text and 3:1 for large text. Use these tables to check whether typography colors (neutral-400, neutral-300, or neutral-100) are accessible when paired with each color in our palette.
