## Dialog props

### modal

In situations where the task is not critical, a nonmodal dialog might be appropriate. Nonmodal dialogs are less offensive than modal ones because they allow users to continue their activity and ignore them if they are irrelevant. However, they can still be disruptive, especially if they obscure important information on the screen or if they require too complex interactions.

<research-insight>
  Use a modal dialog for important warnings, as a way to prevent or correct critical errors. Whenever there is a chance that users’ work be lost or that an action may have destructive, irreversible consequences, interrupt the users to avoid a disaster.
