<lede>The Design System is intentionally flexible. Use it from the start with a new project, incoporate it into an existing project, or use it piece-by-piece based on your needs.</lede>

## Before you start

Each style, component, or pattern will contain what you need for use, but use this page as a general guide.

### React

The Design System is distrubuted as <gatsby-link to="/glossary/#react">React components</gatsby-link> and published on the NPM registry. This means to use the components in your project, you will need to understand and use React.

### HTML, CSS, and JavaScript

We’re so glad you’re interested, but it’s not ready yet! <gatsby-link to="/design-system-team#contact-us">Get in touch</gatsby-link> if you’re interested to help us prioritize what we’re building.

## Using styles

Styles make you service look and feel like a U-M Library service. The design system provides colors, typography, layout, and iconography.

## Using components

Components are reusable tangible parts of the user interface, such as a button, a heading, or an icon. They have been made to support a variety of applications.

### Design System as React components

See the <a href="https://reactjs.org/docs/getting-started.html#learn-react">official React documentation</a> to learn more.

## Using patterns

Patterns are repeating, reusable parts of the interface that can be applied and repurposed to solve a specific design problem, meet a user need, or evoke an emotion, such as handling form errors or getting feedback.

This includes helping users fill out forms, handling errors and validation, and getting feedback from users.
