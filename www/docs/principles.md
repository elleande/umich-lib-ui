title: Principles
---

A set of principles underpins all our design decisions and guides us when we need to make hard choices. This criteria is what makes good design at U-M Library and all design patterns are evaluated against it.

## Our principles

### 1. Simple
Less is more. Prioritized direction over choice. Offer one thought-out optimal path to the user. In most situations, there is a best path, choice or solution. Do research and find out what it is. Do the hard work, so that our users don’t have to.

### 2. Robust
Anyone should be able to understand how our websites work without instruction. It's easy to undo and impossible to break. And when we say ‘anyone’ we mean it. The products and services we create should be accessible for all people, regardless of their mental or physical abilities.

### 3. Backed by research
Understanding user needs is central. Our design, development, and content efforts must be based on what real users need — what they need to do, their obstacles, and their context. Decisions must be informed by this research.

## Our approach

Design Systems are rules, principles, and constraints, implemented in design and code. It aims to: 

- create in context with real projects and not in a bubble
- meet high accessibility standards WCAG 2.1 (A and AA)
- build on the research and experience of other teams
- promote consistency and cohesion
- speed up productivity and onboarding
- avoid repeating work that has already been done
- establish a shared vocabulary, provide helpful documentation
- serve as a future-friendly foundation for the interfaces that make up our web presence
