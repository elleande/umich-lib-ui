## How we decide

The general rule of thumb is any browser with less than 0.1% of all sessions probably doesn’t need to be supported. Exceptions to this rule may come up if a browser has relatively low usage, is no longer supported, and is very hard for us to support.

## Browsers supported

- Chrome: 49+
- Safari (desktop): 10+
- Firefox: 60+
- IE: 11+
- Edge: 16+
- Opera 6+ and Opera Mini
  - Usage of these browsers is low enough that we only support the most modern version
  - Luckily if it works in Chrome, it should work in all the most recent versions of Opera
- Safari for iOS: whatever shipped with iOS 10 and above
  - Most users seem to be keeping up with the latest version of iOS
