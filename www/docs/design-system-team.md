<lede>The Design System team is responsbile for making sure that all styles, components, and patterns published in the system are of a high quality and meet user needs.</lede>

## Why this team exists

The team:

- reviews proposals and contributions against the <gatsby-link to="/contribute/#contribution-criteria">contribution criteria</gatsby-link>
- makes recommendations to help contributors improve their work
- advocates for the needs of end users and the library

This team consults with multidisciplinary groups of representatives from across the library. This means that decisions made are fair and unbiased, and that the Design System reflects the experiences of the whole library and not just one department.

## Members of the team

- Bridget Burke
- Heidi Burkhardt
